            <h2 class="history-text">With the profession of interior design clocking in at just over 100 years old,
                we’re looking at the roots of interior design history and the seven legendary decorators who made a name
                for themselves as the industry started gaining momentum in the early 1900’s. From the Ancient Egyptians
                to the dawn of modern interior design, here’s everything you need to know.
                It may seem a bit elementary, but let’s start with the basics of interior design services. Interior
                design is defined as the art and science of enhancing the interior of a space in order to create a
                polished and more aesthetically pleasing environment. An interior designer is someone trained to execute
                plans, research, coordinate, and manage decorative projects with authority. The profession of interior
                design is varied and includes space planning, conceptual development, site inspections, programming,
                research, communicating with the clients, project and construction management, and of course the
                execution of the desired design.
                Before the profession rose to prominence, interior design came in instinctively to strictly coordinate
                with the architecture of buildings. The profession of interior design came with the rise of middle-class
                society and the complicated architecture that rose to popularity during the industrial revolution. The
                quest to make the best use of space, along with the attention to user well-being and functional design
                continues to push the development and life-enhancing possibilities of today’s iteration on the interior
                design profession. That said, the profession of interior design is distinctly separate from the work of
                an interior decorator, a moniker more commonly used across the US. The term interior decorator is less
                commonly used in the UK where the profession of interior design remains unregulated and sadly, not yet
                considered an official profession to this day.
                As far back as ancient India, architects used to double as interior designers to fully develop their
                complete vision. This can be noted from the references of architect Vishwakarma – one of the gods
                featured in Indian mythology. Those references feature sculptures illustrating ancient texts and events
                seen in palaces constructed in 17th-century India.
                Throughout ancient Egypt, “soul houses” or models of houses were gifted in tombs as vessels for food
                offerings. From these evocative trinkets, it’s possible to decipher cues about the interior design of
                various residences throughout several Egyptian dynasties, including updates to ventilation, porticoes,
                columns, loggias, windows, and doors.</h2>
